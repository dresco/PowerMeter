Description
About Fusion PCB service:

As hobbyists ourselves, we organize local mfg power, panelize designs, reduce the shipping cost, and ensure the quality. It will be a source to sustain our studio along with other services we provide. 

The minimum PCB QTY we accept here is 10 PCs,  price is start from 10 USD / 10 PCs, so it's 1 USD for each PCB.

Note:
Please include your order number in silkscreen layer for fastest transaction!

Please try make your PCB width larger than 20mm to reduce our manufacturing cost.

Fusion PCB Order Steps：

    * Purchase fusion PCB Service from online store and check out.

    * An order number will be provided in confirmation email from Seeed Studio Depot(order@seeedstudio.com) 

    * To make sure orders processed smooth and accurately, Mark your order number in silkscreen layer, pack gerber files into a zip file named D(your order number)_(Your PCB size) For example: D14756_10X10.rar then send your file to pcb(at)seeedstudio.com


If the file and design meets requirements, they will be processed and shipped in 4-6 days (Excluding the Chinese Festival).


Gerber file requirement:
The following layers are needed:

    * Top layer:              pcbname.GTL 
    * Bottom layer:           pcbname.GBL 
    * Solder Stop Mask top:   pcbname.GTS 
    * Solder Stop Mask Bottom pcbname.GBS 
    * Silk Top:               pcbname.GTO 
    * Silk Bottom             pcbname.GBO 
    * NC Drill:               pcbname.TXT 

Note: 

    * Board outline must be included at least in one layer.
    * The Gerber file must be RS-274x format. 

PCB design tips：

    * SINGLE DESIGN, NO PANELIZING
    * Your Gerber file must include only one design
    * Drills line and long slot can't be accepted
    * Minimum slot 1mm*1mm
    * DRC compatible as rule file attached
    * The PCB size is smallest rectangle that can accommodate PCB
